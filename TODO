track servers:
[x] OnNewServer
[x] OnServerConnect
[x] OnServerQuit

track users:
[x] OnUserConnect - make a stored procedure
	[x] add a new user to the user table / update existing user?
	[x] get the server id
	[x] increase the user count in the server info
[x] OnUserQuit - make a stored procedure
	[x] remove the user from the user table
	[x] remove the user from the ison table (OnLeaveChannel is not called on quit)
	[x] decrease the user count in the server info
[x] OnUserNickChange - use a simple UPDATE query
[x] OnFingerprint (store the users fingerprint in the user table)
[x] OnUserModeSet
[x] OnUserModeUnset
[x] OnUserLogin
[x] OnNickLogout
[ ] tracking host change requires adding a new event to anope
[ ] provide geoiplookup through external script/mysql trigger (low priority)

track channels:
[x] OnChannelCreate
[x] OnChannelDelete
[ ] OnChannelModeSet
[ ] OnChannelModeUnset
[ ] OnTopicUpdated
[x] OnLeaveChannel (From either parting, being kicked, or quitting/killed)
[x] OnJoinChannel
[ ] OnSetCurrentModes ?

other stuff:
[ ] OnAddXLine (xlines are not tracked by current phpanope/MagIRC, so this is low priority)
[ ] OnDelXLine
[ ] disable/remove any events on shutdown
    (make it a part of the stored procedure that cleans the users on shutdown)

unclear?
[?] OnChannelModeAdd ? (ircd depend?)
[?] OnBotAssign (make the botserv join the channel?)
[?] OnBotUnassign (make the botserv part the channel?)
[?] OnCreateBot
[?] OnBotKick
[?] MOTD - requires modification of the protocol modules
[?] SERVER PING - requires modification of the protocol modules
    I'm not sure if we really want this feature.
[?] SERVER VERSION - requires modification of the protocol modules
[?] CLIENT VERSION - probably requires a pseudoclient on some ircds/clients?
    needs testing
[?] SWHOIS - requires modification of the protocol modules / adding new events


***************************************************************************************

Known bugs and limitations:
============================
 - botserv bots have no servid, because they get introduced before the local server
     fixes itself on the next anope start if we dont drop the server table
 - OnJoinChannel is not called for botserv bots
 - botserv bots are not added to the ISON table ?
