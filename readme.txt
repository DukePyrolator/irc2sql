irc2sql
=======

This module for anope ( www.anope.org ) provides an irc2sql gateway.
It collects data about users, channels and servers. It doesn't build stats
itself, however, it gives you the database, it's up to you how you use it.

Its designed to be light and fast. The sql scheme is improved, dont expect it
to work with current phpdenora/MagIRC installations.
