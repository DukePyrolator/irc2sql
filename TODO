Denora features that probably wont go into this module:

[?] MOTD - requires modification of the protocol modules
[?] SERVER UPTIME - requires modification of the protocol modules
[?] SERVER PING - requires modification of the protocol modules
    I'm not sure if we really want this feature.
[?] SERVER VERSION - requires modification of the protocol modules
[?] SWHOIS - requires modification of the protocol modules / adding new events
