track servers:
[x] OnNewServer
[x] OnServerConnect
[x] OnServerQuit

track users:
[ ] OnUserConnect - make a stored procedure
	[ ] add a new user to the user table / update existing user?
	[ ] get the server id
	[ ] increase the user count in the server info?
[ ] OnUserQuit - make a stored procedure
	[ ] remove the user from the user table
	    or set it to inactive to provide a /whowas function?
	[ ] decrease the user count in the server info?
[ ] OnUserNickChange - use a simple UPDATE query
[ ] OnFingerprint (store the users fingerprint in the user table)
[ ] OnUserModeSet
[ ] OnUserModeUnset
[ ] OnNickLogin (update mode +r and accountinfo)
[ ] OnNickLogout (update mode +r and accountinfo)
[ ] host change?
[ ] provide geoiplookup through external script/mysql trigger (low priority)

track channels:
[ ] OnCreateChan (channel creation)
[ ] OnDelChan (last user parts the channel and its not permanent)
[ ] OnChannelModeSet
[ ] OnChannelModeUnset
[ ] OnTopicUpdated
[ ] OnLeaveChannel (From either parting, being kicked, or quitting/killed)
[ ] OnJoinChannel
[ ] OnSetCurrentModes ?

other stuff:
[ ] OnAddXLine (xlines are not tracked by current phpanope/MagIRC, so this is low priority)
[ ] OnDelXLine
[ ] cleanup "script" as mysql event to remove users/servers who are not online after a given time
    [ ] readd a timestamp field to the tables to track when they gone off
    [ ] add config options for how long we want to keep offline users + servers
[ ] disable/remove any events on shutdown
    (make it a part of the stored procedure that cleans the users on shutdown)

unclear?
[?] OnChannelModeAdd ? (ircd depend?)
[?] OnBotAssign (make the botserv join the channel?)
[?] OnBotUnassign (make the botserv part the channel?)
[?] OnCreateBot
[?] OnBotKick
[?] MOTD - requires modification of the protocol modules
[?] SERVER PING - requires modification of the protocol modules
    I'm not sure if we really want this feature.
[?] SERVER VERSION - requires modification of the protocol modules
[?] CLIENT VERSION - probably requires a pseudoclient on some ircds/clients?
    needs testing
